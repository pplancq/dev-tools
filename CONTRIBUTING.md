## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[@pplancq/dev-tools Code of Conduct](https://github.com/pplancq/dev-tools/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](https://github.com/pplancq/dev-tools).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/pplancq/dev-tools/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/pplancq/dev-tools/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

## How to contribute to this project?

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub
2. **Clone** the fork on your local machine
3. **Commit** the changes to your own branch, see the section on [Commit conventions](#commit-conventions)
4. **Push** your work to your fork
5. Submit a **Pull request** so we can review your proposal

## Commit conventions

We follow the conventions of [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). This means that the commit message must be structured as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

For example:

```
feat(react-template): add a new feature
fix(webpack-config): fix a bug
```

## Branch naming

Branch names should be prefixed with `feature/` or `bugfix/` depending on the type of work you're doing on the branch.
For example, if you're working on a new authentication feature, you could name your branch `feature/authentication`.

## How do I report a bug?

If you find a bug in the project :

1. Search the project's issues to see if the bug has already been reported. If so, add a comment to the existing issue instead of creating a new one.
2. If you can't find a matching issue, create a new one. Provide details about the bug, including steps to reproduce it, the impact of the bug and expected behavior.

Thank you for contributing to this project!
