# 📁 components

The "components" folder is a crucial element of any React application. It is used to organize and store reusable components that make up the user interface of your application. React components are self-contained pieces of the user interface, each having its own logic and rendering.

1. **Modularity** : Components can be reused across different parts of your application. This promotes code modularity and allows you to maintain your application more efficiently.

2. **Clarity** : By grouping all your components in a "components" folder, it is easier to understand the structure of your application. It also facilitates the search and management of components.

3. **Better Organization** : Organizing components in a dedicated folder helps clearly distinguish components from other elements of the application, such as styles, images, or configuration files.

## <span id="usage">🧑🏻‍💻 Usage Example </span>

Suppose you have a "Header.js" component in the "components" folder. You can import and use it in other parts of your application like this:

```javascript
import Header from '@Front/components/Header';

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      {/* ... other elements of the application */}
    </div>
  );
};
```
