# 📁 assets

The "assets" folder is a commonly used directory in a React application to store static resources such as images, CSS files, fonts, JSON data files, icons, and other non-JavaScript files used in your application. These resources are typically needed to style and customize the user interface of your application.

1. **Organization** : By storing your static resources in a separate folder named "assets," you maintain a cleaner and more organized project structure. This clearly separates static content from JavaScript files.

2. **Ease of Access** : Files in the "assets" folder can be easily referenced in your code using relative paths. This simplifies the inclusion of images, CSS, fonts, and other resources in your React components.

3. **Performance Optimization** : By storing static resources like images in an "assets" folder, you can optimize these files for better performance, for example, by using image compression tools.

## <span id="usage">🧑🏻‍💻 Usage Example </span>

To use an image stored in the "assets" folder, you can reference its relative path in your JavaScript or JSX code like this:

```javascript
import logo from '@Front/assets/images/logo.png';

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <img src={logo} alt="Logo" />
      {/* ... other elements of the application */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## <span id="best-practice">🎖️ Best Practice</span>

When it comes to styling and managing assets, adopting the following practices can enhance maintainability and structure in your project:

### - Global CSS Rules

Define all global CSS rules, such as resets, fonts, and general styling, in a centralized stylesheet (in the css folder under the assets ).

This ensures consistency across your entire application.

### - CSS Modules

For component-specific styles, leverage CSS Modules to encapsulate styles within the component scope.

This helps prevent unintentional styling conflicts and promotes a modular approach to styling.

**_By adhering to these practices, you create a clear separation between global styles and component-specific styles, making your codebase more maintainable and scalable._**
