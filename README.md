# @pplancq/dev-tools

This repository aims to provide tools for developing ReactJS applications.\
A React template is available to facilitate the creation of new React projects, particularly for creating micro front-end applications.

## How to use

To generate a new React project, simply run the following command:

```shell
npm create @pplancq/react-app@latest <project_name>
```

Replace <project_name> with the name of your new project.

## @pplancq/react-template

The React template @pplancq/react-template provides all the useful preconfigured packages to start a new React project easily. It also provides a folder structure to facilitate and structure the code.

Unlike Facebook's create-react-app, the Webpack configuration remains easily expandable.
